<P>You can playback your own solutions or you can see solutions which are stored in the Sokoban’s database. You can open the list of all levels and their solutions by pressing F1 or spacebar. Symbol 0-0 means no solution. Otherwise there are numbers which mean moves-pushes. Try to find a solution that has minimal moves + pushes.</P>

<P>Start playback by pressing F9 or from menu. You can control playback by buttons on the toolbar or you can use keys 1 to 9 on the left side of the keyboard. You can change playback speed in the options dialog. </P>

<P>Playback is finished when you press the right-most button on the toolbar or some of the keys 0, ESC, F9. Then you can continue playing from that position and you can also use undo and redo.</P>
